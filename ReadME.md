## To Start

The Conda environment is in "requirements.txt". The main folder is the "attention" folder, and "train_scripts.sh" has commands to run the codes. 
You should run "clustering_feature.py" first to generate the clusters, then run "run_attention.py" can do the training. 
The "pretrained_models" folder is used to store pre-trained models and the "celeba-caption" folder is used to store the corpus.
